Brief Analysis ­

We can see that there are pages with high in­link values have low page ranks, which means large number of inlinks is not the absolute reason to contribute a high pagerank.

In WG1, International_Standard_Book_Number and Integrated_Authority_File not only have high Page Rank, but also have high in-links, so do WT21-B37-76 and WT21-B37-75 in WG2.
