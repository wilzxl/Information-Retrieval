According to the top 5 ranking results above, we can conclude that the Page Rank scores is related to the number of inlink nodes, but it's not absolute, because the number of inlink nodes of a link do enhance the probability of the link being entered, but links from some hot links also have high probability even though they may not have many inlink nodes.
